# 000077 — feat/triaged-service

**Agent:** Claude (claude-opus-4-8) @ triage branch feat/triaged-service

## Intent

Make `triaged` runnable as a managed, per-user background service on all
supported platforms, so users no longer launch it by hand in a terminal. The
Windows daemon support (PR #87) made the daemon *run* on Windows; this branch
makes it *run as a login service* on macOS (LaunchAgent), Linux (systemd
`--user`), and Windows (Scheduled Task at logon).

Also folds in the four deferred Windows daemon follow-ups from #87:
1. Safe cleanups (redundant serve() probe, pipe-name length guard, test race).
2. Bounded named-pipe connect (timeout instead of unbounded wait).
3. `%LOCALAPPDATA%` for upgraded web assets on Windows.
4. Rename `UnixSocket*` → cross-platform `Ipc*`; de-dup per-platform serve.

## Decisions

- 2026-06-18T21:40-07:00 Per-user / login scope (not system/boot) — the daemon
  owns the user's interactive PTYs and a per-user socket/pipe, so it must run in
  the user's session. System services run as SYSTEM/root in session 0 and can't
  own interactive ConPTY or per-user paths.
- 2026-06-18T21:40-07:00 Hand-rolled per-platform registration over the
  `service-manager` crate — that crate's Windows path is `sc.exe` (system
  service, session 0), wrong for an interactive per-user daemon. Hand-rolling
  launchd/systemd/schtasks keeps full control and stays dependency-light.
- 2026-06-18T21:40-07:00 Template builders (plist/unit/schtasks argv) are plain
  cfg-independent functions so they unit-test on all three CI runners; only the
  side-effecting load/enable step is cfg-gated.

## What Changed

- 2026-06-18T21:48-07:00 `crates/triaged/src/service.rs` (new) — `triaged
  service <install|uninstall|start|stop|status>` CLI. `ServiceContext::detect`
  resolves the running binary via `std::env::current_exe()` and embeds it into
  the registration. Per-platform `platform` modules: macOS LaunchAgent via
  `launchctl load -w`, Linux systemd user unit via `systemctl --user enable
  --now`, Windows logon task via `schtasks /Create /SC ONLOGON` (windowless
  through `cmd /c start "" /b`). A `not(any(...))` fallback bails cleanly.
  Template builders (`plist_contents`, `systemd_unit_contents`,
  `schtasks_create_args`) are pure and gated `cfg(any(<platform>, test))` so they
  compile-and-test on every CI runner without dead-code warnings in non-test
  platform builds. 4 unit tests cover all three templates + XML escaping.
- 2026-06-18T21:48-07:00 `crates/triaged/src/main.rs` — dispatch `args[1] ==
  "service"` to `service::run_cli` before the daemon path; `--handover`
  unchanged.
- 2026-06-18T21:48-07:00 `crates/triaged/src/lib.rs` — `pub mod service;`.
- 2026-06-18T21:48-07:00 `crates/triaged/README.md` — "Running as a background
  service" section: command table, per-platform mechanism/location table, and a
  `loginctl enable-linger` note for surviving logout on Linux.

### Windows daemon follow-ups (from #87)

- 2026-06-18T21:55-07:00 `crates/triaged/src/ipc.rs` — **Safe cleanups.**
  Removed the Windows `serve()` self-connect "already in use" preflight;
  `create_sync()` sets `FILE_FLAG_FIRST_PIPE_INSTANCE`, so a second daemon's
  create fails atomically (the probe could itself block and left a phantom
  connection in the accept loop). The create error context now hints "is another
  triaged already running?". Added a 210-char length cap to `windows_pipe_token`:
  an over-long token collapses to a readable prefix + sha256 hash so it stays
  under the 256-char NPFS limit and unique per path. Windows-only test
  `windows_pipe_token_caps_overlong_names` covers it.
- 2026-06-18T22:05-07:00 `crates/triaged/src/ipc.rs` — **Bounded connect.** The
  Windows client now connects via the raw named-pipe stream
  (`DuplexPipeStream::<Bytes>::connect_by_path_with_wait_mode`) with a 5s
  `ConnectWaitMode::Timeout`, instead of the cross-platform `local_socket`
  connect that hardcodes an unbounded wait. A missing daemon still fails fast
  (the pipe doesn't exist); only an all-instances-busy pipe (`ERROR_PIPE_BUSY`)
  consumes the timeout, so a busy pipe can no longer block the client forever.
  Introduced a `transport::ClientStream` alias (Unix `UnixStream`; Windows the
  named-pipe stream) distinct from the server-accepted `LocalStream`; `connect`
  and `finish_write` now take `ClientStream`. This also mitigates the test
  readiness-probe race — a throwaway probe connection that momentarily consumes
  the single pipe instance now bounds the real client's wait at 5s (re-arm is
  microseconds) instead of risking an unbounded block. Confirmed the API against
  interprocess 2.4.2 source; validated only by the `windows-latest` CI runner.
- 2026-06-18T22:12-07:00 `crates/triaged/src/http.rs` — **`%LOCALAPPDATA%` web
  assets.** `default_override_dir` now returns `%LOCALAPPDATA%\triage\web` on
  Windows (falling back to `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local`), instead of the
  Unix-style `~/.local/share`. The Unix branch is unchanged byte-for-byte to
  avoid shifting the path for existing installs. Both the daemon (reads) and the
  client upgrade flow (writes) call this one function, so they stay in agreement.

- 2026-06-18T22:20-07:00 `crates/triaged/src/ipc.rs` (+ triage, triage-mcp)
  — **Type rename + dedup.** Renamed the now-cross-platform `UnixSocketConfig` /
  `UnixSocketServer` / `UnixSocketClient` → `IpcConfig` / `IpcServer` /
  `IpcClient` across all five referencing files. De-duplicated the two `serve`
  accept loops via a shared `spawn_client_handler` (the thread-spawn +
  benign-disconnect filter), and the two `handle_connection` bodies via a shared
  `dispatch_request` (subscribe-stream vs one-shot request/response); each
  platform handler keeps only its genuinely-divergent part (Unix stream-clone +
  SCM_RIGHTS handover; Windows single-stream + handover bail).

## Issues

- 2026-06-18T21:45-07:00 Dead-code under `-D warnings` differs per target: the
  pure builders are unused in non-test platform builds (e.g. `systemd_unit_*` on
  macOS), `ServiceContext.log_dir` was unused off macOS, and `home_dir` is unused
  on Windows. Resolved by `cfg(any(<platform>, test))` gating the builders +
  consts, dropping `log_dir` from the struct (macOS computes it inline), and
  gating `home_dir`/`default_log_dir` to the platforms that use them. Verified
  clean on host (macOS) and `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`; Linux deferred to CI (no
  local cross-linker for ring's C deps).

## Next Steps

- Implement `service` subcommand + per-platform registration + tests.
- Fold in the four Windows follow-ups, each as its own commit.
